Setting Up the MySQL Environment:
To set up the MySQL environment, follow these steps:

1.Install MySQL:
Visit the MySQL official website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install MySQL.

2.Configure MySQL:
During the installation, you'll be prompted to set a root password. Make sure to choose a strong password and remember it as it grants full access to the MySQL server.

3.Start MySQL Server:
After the installation is complete, you'll need to start the MySQL server. Depending on your operating system, this can be done as a service or through a control panel.

4.Verify Installation:
Open a command prompt or terminal and enter the following command to check if MySQL is running:

                                                        mysql -u root -p

You'll be prompted to enter the root password you set during the installation. If successful, you'll be logged into the MySQL shell.

Introduction to Databases:

A database is an organized collection of data that is structured and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of information. Databases are used to store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of data in various applications, ranging from simple to complex systems. They are an integral part of modern software development and play a crucial role in powering websites, mobile apps, enterprise systems, and more.

There are different types of databases, but the most commonly used ones fall into two main categories:

1. Relational Databases: In this type of database, data is organized into tables with rows and columns, forming a structured format. The relationship between tables is defined through keys (primary and foreign keys), enabling data retrieval through SQL (Structured Query Language) queries.

2. Non-Relational Databases: These databases store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores. They are more flexible and scalable than relational databases, making them suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
